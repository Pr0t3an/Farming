# Farming

Best intentions of somewhat maintaining some scripts to do some specific actions mostly for my own benefit - but if someone else finds them useful then whoop whoop.

---------------------------
<b>RiRiPy.py</b> Named after the delightful Rihanna - early version of script to invoke full functionality of Cisco Umbrella    / OpenDNS investigate - will only search one domain at the mo.

Usage

RiRIPy.py -h (self explanitory)
RiRiPy.py -b (probably most useful at the mo - barebones info on the domain)

Search 'CHANGEME' and update with your API key

Planned

Need to move away from optparse...was the quickest during dev
Add support for output info to a file
Add multi domain support - input from txt file/csv. Output to CSV or something
